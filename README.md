# Scripts
### scripts/macos-setup.sh
In the absence of any configuration management environment, this script fetches,
installs, and (eventually) configures a mac workstation for general development
tasks.

Currently, it installs the following:
..* [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
..* [XCode CLI Tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html)
..* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
...* wget
...* awscli
...* macvim
...* unbound
...* zsh
...* zsh-completions
..* [Pip (Python Package Manager)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
...* virtualenvwrapper
..* [oh-my-zsh Zsh Management Framework](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
